        You will need only a few basic things to get hacking:
        <ul>
          <li>At least 1 computer</li>
          <li>At most 3 other teammates</li>
          <li>24 hours</li>
          <li>Flexibility</li>
          <li>Tenacity</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="emphatic">Hacking is hard work!</p>
        It can be emotional. It can be frustrating.
        Teams that do well are ones that know how to get UNSTUCK.
        If you find yourself getting stuck on something:
        <ul>
          <li>Ask for help</li>
          <li>Cut the feature you were working on</li>
          <li>HACK! Find a way _around_ what you're stuck on</li>
        </ul>
        Other than this, the only thing you need (as in life) is to
        <p class="emphatic">have fun</p>

        One of the best ways to get started is to find something cool
        and then play with it and make something even cooler out of it.
        It can be anything:
        <ul>
          <li>A dataset</li>
          <li>A really cool open source library</li>
          <li>A powerful new API</li>
        </ul>
        or just make that series of bash scripts that you've been meaning to for a while now.
        You can build <i>anything</i>
        <p>(Please have it involve technology though ^_^)</p>
        <section class="subheading">
          Some examples:
        </section>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimap/opcbonhbaamhjmlbcedangecgjjiollh">A chrome extension</a> that previews as you scroll</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~elancast/fb/">A Facebook skin</a> that looks exactly like Google</li>
          <li><a href="http://ninjaquote.com/">A game</a> that tests your knowledge of your friends</li>
        </ul>
        have all won Facebook hackathons in the past.

        To get started you'll need the right tools. Please do all of the following in order:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Android</b>: 
            <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/classic.php">IDE</a> -> 
            <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html">ADT</a> -> 
            <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html">SDK</a>
          </li>
          <li><b>iPhone</b>:
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">IDE</a> ->
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/FirstTutorial.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011343-CH3-SW1">SDK</a>

        </ul>
        or you can consider using <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> to write your app in JS and html. This is especially useful if people on your team have different devices.

        If your mobile app will need to store data in a persistant way,
        particularly over web, it is recommended that you use <a href="https://www.parse.com">Parse</a>.
        Parse gives you amazing <a href="https://parse.com/docs/downloads/">SDKs</a> for 
        <a href="https://parse.com/docs/ios_guide#top/iOS">iPhone</a>,
        <a href="https://parse.com/docs/android_guide">Android</a>, and 
        <a href="https://parse.com/docs/dotnet_guide">Windows Phone</a>.
        See <a href="https://parse.com/tutorials">their tutorials</a>
      
      to get started.

        <p>At Facebook Hackathons we ask that you host your apps somewhere so that other people can use your hack! You have a couple options, depending on what language you want to write your server logic in. The recommended services are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> - For PHP, Python, Java and Ruby servers. See <a href="http://www.davemercurio.com/hackathon/workshop.html">Dave Mercurio's excellent guide</a> for getting started with Heroku</li>
          <li><a href="https://parse.com/docs/cloud_code_guide">Parse</a> - For purely JS apps (using <a href="expressjs.com">express</a> or <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        If you've never done web programming before, the examples <a href="http://paulisageek.com/webintro/">here</a> (PHP) will give you some idea how to get started.

        We love to see people make apps that integrate with Facebook! The first step to making a Facebook app is just to make a normal web app (see above).  After you've gotten your web app going, register you Facebook App <a href="developers.facebook.com/apps">here</a> and checkout our <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/apis/">documentation</a> then start playing with <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer">the explorer</a>.
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Facebook has SDKs for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios">iOS</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android">Android</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/web">The web</a> (including <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/php/gettingstarted">PHP</a> and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/gettingstarted/">JS</a>)</li>

        </ul>
        If you're making a Facebook canvas app, <a href="http://www.davemercurio.com/waterloo/index.phps">this boilerplate PHP</a> should help you get started, as will <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/canvas-games">this tutorial</a>.

        Some of the coolest hackathon projects are games. Thankfully people have built some amazing platforms for you to get started quickly. I highly recommend using <a href="http://unity3d.com/learn">Unity</a>. Not only does Unity work across <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/iphone-GettingStarted.html">mobile</a>, <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/multiplatform/desktop">native</a> and <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/WebPlayerDeployment.html">web</a>, it also works amazingly well with <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity">Facebook</a> for social features and with <a href="https://www.parse.com/docs/unity_guide">Parse</a> to make persisting data trivially easy.

        As said above, the main point is to have fun and learn something new.  That said, you win by also making something cool.  Judging is kind of subjective but is 50/50:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Idea:</b> Something exciting we've never seen before. Something that sounds useful, fun or engaging. Something people <i>want</i>.</li>
          <li style="padding-top: 15px;"><b>Execution:</b> Built really well. Acutally does what it set out to do: no more, no less. Has a useful interface, is hosted somewhere where the judges can play with it, and is technically impressive.</li>
